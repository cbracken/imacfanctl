iMac SMB Fan Control Daemon

Sets fans to maximum safe value on iMac startup. Currently targets iMac6,2
(24" 2006 white Intel Core2 Duo) only. These machines are notorious for
a logic board issue causing panics/graphic issues when GPU temperature hits
39-40C.

Ubuntu (11.04) package dependencies:
  lm-sensors
